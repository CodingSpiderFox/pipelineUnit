# pipelineUnit

This project demonstrates how to write unit tests for Jenkins pipeline code including declarative pipelines, scripted pipelines and shared libraries. The framework does not strictly validate the pipeline syntax but it will emulate the pipeline using JenkinsPipelineUnit frameworks and can validate any groovy sript sections in the pipeline and logic. It may not be complete for all pipeline syntax.

It is using Spock, Gradle and Groovy and the JenkinsPipelineUnit framework available here: https://github.com/lesfurets/JenkinsPipelineUnit
